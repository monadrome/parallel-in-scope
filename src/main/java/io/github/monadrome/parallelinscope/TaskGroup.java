/**
 * A fixed, heterogeneous set of named tasks submitted at one explicit boundary.
 *
 * <p>A group is described by a reusable {@link TaskGroupDefinition} and submitted via {@link
 * #submit(GlobalPar, TaskGroupDefinition)}, which builds, starts, and submits all members in one call.
 * Member futures are looked up by name ({@link #members()}, {@link #findMember(String)}) or through
 * the typed {@link TaskKey} keys registered while configuring the definition ({@link #future(TaskKey)}).
 *
 * <p>A definition may declare one terminal combine: a real scoped task that depends on every member.
 * Its key, execution context, and TTL snapshot are prepared at submit like a member's, but it is
 * submitted to its own {@code Par} only after all members succeed, and the group completes only when
 * its future is terminal. Its future resolves through {@link #future(TaskKey)} like a member's, yet
 * it is not part of {@link #members()}.
 *
 * <p>Cancellation is fully structured: a member failure, a direct member cancellation, the group
 * deadline, or any single member deadline cancels every unfinished member. All outcomes are
 * attributed by reading {@link CancellationToken} states after the fact — never by capturing who
 * initiated a cancel — so attribution stays correct under races.
