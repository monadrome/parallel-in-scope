/**
 * Shared single-task preparation and submission used by both entry points.

 * <p>{@code Par.map} and {@code TaskGroup} must not each grow their own copy of the
 * scoped-task pipeline. This class owns the two pieces that are identical for every task:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Wrapping a user {@link Callable} with {@link ScopedCallable} lifecycle instrumentation and
 *       a TTL snapshot, and presenting it as an {@link ExecutionPhaseHintFuture}
 *   <li>Submitting a prepared future inside the {@link SubmissionScope} of its batch, with the
 *       CPU-bound inline fallback on executor rejection
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The entry points keep their distinct topologies on top of this: the batch path drives a
 * sliding window through {@link SlidingWindowSubmitter}, while the task group freezes every
 * prepared member before submitting any of them.
