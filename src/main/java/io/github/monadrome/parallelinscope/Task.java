/**
 * The {@link TaskFuture} implementation the library delivers; it is package-private because
 * instances are never constructed by users and never appear in a public signature — callers only
 * ever see the {@link TaskFuture} contract.
 *
 * <p>A task is a thin forwarding shell over the future that actually carries its outcome, plus the
 * name and {@link CancellationToken} that belong to the task rather than to that future. The shell
 * owns its identity from creation on: a future waiting for a free concurrency slot already answers
 * with its final name, deadline, and token attribution before anything is submitted, and neither
 * submission nor abandonment changes them.
 *
 * <p>Forwarding is literal: {@link #get()}, {@link #cancel(boolean)}, {@link #isDone()}, and
 * {@link #addListener(Runnable, java.util.concurrent.Executor)} behave exactly as they do on the
 * delegate, including the interruption and cancellation-cascade semantics. Only read-only
 * information is added.
 *
 * <p>Two shapes exist, created by {@link #of} and {@link #placeholder}. A placeholder is handed to
 * the caller before its task has an executor slot; it stays registered with the caller's own
 * listeners and cancellations, and is later bound to the real future — or abandoned, when the task
 * will never run.
