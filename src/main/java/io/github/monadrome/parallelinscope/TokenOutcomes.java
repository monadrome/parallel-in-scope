/**
 * Maps a {@link CancellationToken}'s committed state onto the {@link TaskOutcome} of the work it
 * canceled. This is the single implementation of the token-to-outcome attribution table shared by
 * {@code TaskGroup} member classification, {@code ScopedCallable} listener events, and {@code
 * TaskBatchResult} reports.
 *
 * <p>The mapping reads the token as the single authority, because a token commits its state before
 * canceling the futures bound to it:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code TIMEOUT} → {@link TaskOutcome#TIMEOUT}
 *   <li>{@code FAIL_FAST} → {@link TaskOutcome#FAIL_FAST}
 *   <li>{@code CANCELED} → {@link TaskOutcome#GROUP_CANCELED}: the token-as-a-whole was canceled,
 *       which is the post-hoc view of the owning unit. A caller doing direct observation of one
 *       task's own cancellation (see {@code ScopedCallable}) intercepts {@code CANCELED} first and
 *       reports {@link TaskOutcome#MEMBER_CANCELED} instead
 *   <li>{@code PROPAGATED_CANCELED} → the token carries no reason of its own, so {@link
 *       CancellationToken#originState()} walks the parent chain: an originating {@code TIMEOUT}
 *       stays {@link TaskOutcome#TIMEOUT}, anything else is {@link TaskOutcome#GROUP_CANCELED}
 *   <li>{@code RUNNING}/{@code SUCCESS} → no framework cancellation path committed; the caller
 *       supplies what an unattributed cancellation means in its context via {@code whenUncommitted}
 * </ul>
