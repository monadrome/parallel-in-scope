/**
 * A bounded FIFO blocking queue with a one-way draining close.
 *
 * <p>Lifecycle is a one-way three-state machine: {@code OPEN → DRAINING → DRAINED}. {@link
 * #close()} moves {@code OPEN} to {@code DRAINING}: producers are permanently rejected, while
 * consumers keep receiving real elements until the queue is empty. If the queue is empty when
 * {@code close()} takes effect, it publishes {@code DRAINED} in that same critical section.
 * Otherwise, the removal or drain of the final real element publishes {@code DRAINED} in the same
 * critical section as that element's ownership transfer. Therefore, when a call receives the last
 * real element, {@link #isDrained()} is already {@code true} when the call returns.
 *
 * <p>Every element for which a write method has successfully returned remains reachable through a
 * normal consumer operation or {@link #drainTo(Collection)} until one of those operations removes
 * it. Closing never discards or isolates accepted work. A configured poison is consequently a
 * <em>virtual terminal signal</em>, not an element: it is never returned before {@code DRAINED}
 * and never appears in snapshots, iterators, or streams. At {@code DRAINED}, value-returning
 * consumer methods return that poison when configured; otherwise special-value methods return
 * {@code null} and required-value methods throw {@link NoSuchElementException}.
 *
 * <p>The lifecycle rules are applied in this order: input validation first; real queued elements
 * take precedence over every terminal rule; closed producers are rejected; terminal consumers see
 * the poison or their normal empty result; and the configured mutation strategy applies only once
 * drained. Thus, after {@link #close()}, {@code add}/{@code put}/{@code offer} either throw
 * {@link IllegalStateException} or return {@code false}, without storing or waiting; consumers
 * still receive real elements while any remain; collection mutations ({@code clear}/{@code
 * remove}/{@code removeIf}/{@code removeAll}/{@code retainAll}) remain legal while draining and
 * are governed by {@link ShutdownPolicy}'s {@code mutations} strategy only after
 * {@code DRAINED}; and {@code drainTo} stays available in every state to remove remaining work.
 * Use {@link #isShutdown()} to ask whether producers were rejected and {@link #isDrained()} to ask
 * whether the queue is empty and terminal; a closed but non-empty queue is in the {@link
 * #isDraining()} state.
 *
 * <p>Blocking methods react to lifecycle publication rather than interrupting user threads.
 * Closing wakes blocked producers and consumers so they re-evaluate their method-specific rule;
 * it never leaves a producer waiting for capacity after close. An external thread interruption
 * remains an {@link InterruptedException} and is not swallowed by a close result. {@link
 * #awaitDrained()} waits only for terminal-state publication, not for previously admitted calls to
 * finish returning to their callers.
 *
 * <p>Implementation follows {@link java.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingQueue}'s two-lock structure
 * with Guava {@link Monitor monitors}: a producer monitor guards enqueue and capacity, a consumer
 * monitor guards dequeue and emptiness, and an {@link AtomicInteger} count publishes size across
 * both monitors. Lifecycle state is volatile so that close and drained publication release waiters
 * on either side through the monitors' rolling guard re-evaluation. Operations that need both
 * monitors always acquire producer then consumer. User code—element equality, collection
 * callbacks, predicates, and {@code toString()}—runs after queue monitors have been released.
