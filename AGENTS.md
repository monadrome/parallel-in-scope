## Project

**parallel-in-scope** is a structured-concurrency toolkit for Java 8+ built on
Guava `ListenableFuture` and Alibaba `TransmittableThreadLocal`.

- Maven coordinates: `io.github.huatalk:parallel-in-scope:0.2.0`
- Java source/target 1.8 (tests compiled with release 11); JUnit 5 via Surefire

## Commands

Run from the repository root.

```bash
mvn test                                      # all tests
mvn test -Dtest=<ClassName>#<methodName>      # targeted test
mvn spotless:apply                            # format
mvn clean verify                              # tests + package checks
```

## Architecture

Base package: `io.github.huatalk.parallelinscope`.

| Package | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `scope` | API facade |
| `cancel` | Cancellation subsystem |
| `context` | TTL/TL context propagation |
| `context.graph` | Livelock and cycle detection |
| `internal` | Execution engine |
| `queue` | Scheduling queues |
| `spi` | Extension points (listeners, phases) |

Two invariants to respect:

- `CancellationToken.lateBind()` wires timeout, fail-fast, and parent
  propagation only after all futures are submitted.
- `ConcurrentLimitExecutor.submitAll()` returns the exact queued
  `FutureRunnable` object.

## Key Conventions

- Java 8 APIs only in `src/main/java`.
- Every package has `package-info.java` with `@ParametersAreNonnullByDefault`;
  annotate only exceptions with `@Nullable` — `javax.annotation.Nullable` for
  public API/SPI, `org.checkerframework.checker.nullness.qual.Nullable` for
  internal code (both provided scope).
- Logging goes through JUL (`java.util.logging.Logger`).
- Pre-stable API: public APIs and SPI may change between `0.x` releases without
  compatibility shims. During the `0.x` phase, a breaking change is acceptable
  when it provides a meaningful improvement and has a sufficiently documented
  rationale; do not preserve an awkward API solely for compatibility.
- For public API renames or signature changes, update the implementation,
  tests, user documentation, and migration notes as one change. Keep the
  rationale explicit so future maintainers can distinguish intentional API
  evolution from accidental breakage.

## Testing

- Add or update tests when changing cancellation, context propagation, executor
  binding, or queue behavior.
- Run `mvn test` before finishing changes that touch the execution engine or
  public API.

## Ask Before

- Installing Maven dependencies or upgrading plugin versions.
- Deleting files or directories.
- Full release builds, PIT mutation tests, or `mvn deploy`.

Never commit secrets, `.env` files, GPG keys, or repository credentials.

## Reference Documents

- `docs/en/user-guide.md` - Read when changing user-facing behavior.
- `docs/en/migration-v0.2.md` - Breaking changes from the `0.1.x` API.
