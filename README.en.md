> Latest published release: `v0.2.0`. This tree documents the upcoming `0.3.0` API, a breaking redesign of the task-group surface; migrating from `0.2.x`? See the [v0.3 migration guide](docs/en/migration-v0.3.md).

A structured-concurrency toolkit for Java 8+ with bounded batch submission, cooperative cancellation, context propagation, and task-graph diagnostics.

## Quick Start

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.monadrome</groupId>
    <artifactId>parallel-in-scope</artifactId>
    <version>0.3.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Create the application execution topology once. A named `Par` is bound to its executor at build time; choose it before calling `map`, not per invocation.

```java
GlobalPar global = GlobalPar.builder()
        .register("io", Executors.newFixedThreadPool(8))
        .defaultPar("io")
        .build();

BatchOptions options = BatchOptions.timeout("fetch-user", Duration.ofSeconds(3))
        .parallelism(4)
        .taskType(TaskType.IO_BOUND);

TaskBatchResult<User> result = global.par("io")
        .map(userIds, userService::findById, options);
```

`GlobalPar.close()` releases framework-owned timer and submitter resources. It deliberately does not shut down the executor services supplied to `register`; their owner must do that.

## v0.3 Migration

`ParName`, `TaskKey`, `TaskGroupOptions`, `CombineFunction`, `CompletedTaskValues`, and `TaskGroupListener` are removed, and `TaskGroupDefinition` no longer stores callables. Build a structure-only definition with `global.defineGroup(name, timeout)`, declare typed members with `Builder.task(name, par)`, and submit one run's bodies through `global.submitGroup(definition, bindings)`; observe completion with `Futures.addCallback(group.completionFuture(), callback, executor)`. See the [v0.3 migration guide](docs/en/migration-v0.3.md) before upgrading an existing application.

## v0.2 Migration

`ParConfig`, `ParOptions`, `GlobalParConfig`, `Par.getInstance()`, `new Par(...)`, and `Par.map(executorName, ...)` are removed. Use `GlobalPar`, `BatchOptions` (`TaskOptions` for group members and combines), and `global.par(name).map(...)` instead. See the [v0.2 migration guide](docs/en/migration-v0.2.md).

## Core Capabilities

- Immutable application topology with multiple named, executor-bound `Par` entries
- Per-call options resolved into a `MultiTaskContext`
- Fail-fast, timeout, manual, and parent-to-child cooperative cancellation
- Sliding-window submission with terminal results for tasks that were never submitted
- Cross-`Par` nested calls with task/executor identity graph recording
- Optional, threshold-driven cancellation purge per physical `ThreadPoolExecutor`
- Draining-close lifecycle queue `DrainingBlockingQueue` (consumers keep draining after close)
